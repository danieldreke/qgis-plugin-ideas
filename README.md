### QGIS Plugin Ideas

#### Within Range Of
This plugin checks wether cells of one raster are within range of cells of another raster. Distance is given in number of cells or units which will be rounded to number of cells.

#### Neighbourhood Sum
This plugin calculates the sum of a neighbourhood of cells. Shape can be of any size and of box or circular type.

#### Monthly Rasters Statistics
This plugin loops through monthly rasters and adds zonal statistic columns like count, sum or mean to a vector layer.

#### Minimize Legend
This plugin removes legend entries of a layer if value does not exist.

#### Raster Calculator 2
This plugin is inspired by existing Raster Calculator, but allows:
- Temporary layer / no need to set save to
- Data type
- Save options:
  - CRS
  - No data value
  - Compression
  
#### Save Raster
This plugin allows setting data type additionally to `Export > Save as` options.
